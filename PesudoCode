To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

Allow the user to enter their location (zip code is probably easiest) and press a button to load the weather by creating an API GET request

If the request is successful, display the following in a 'mobile app' format:

    single card container 
    <div col-4> ish

    structure with ids to hav java grab it later
    a search bar to input the zip code



            City name
            Current weather conditions
            Current temperature in Kelvin, Fahrenheit, and Celsius
            A unique image, selected by the current temperature (The API has icons)

If the request is unsuccessful, display a specific error message.

Additional Requirements

        Website must be responsive
        Website must be styled
        Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website. 


Stretch Goals

    Get weather based on location data (no need for user input)
    Use more data provided by the api (forecast data, historical data, daily change in weather, etc.)
    Create a list of Personas that could be used in an MVP
    Use JS to render the entire app (nothing except a <div id='main'></div> in the body of your index.html)


shuld this behave like the mind reader?
